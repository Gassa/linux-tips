(常用于嵌入式系统).\n8.make allmodconfig\n尽可能多的使用“m”设置内核选项值来生成配置文件\n下载好Linux内核源代码后，在源代码的根目录执行\nmake localyesconfig或者make localmodconfig\n然后系统就会根据你的硬件自动生成一个适应你的硬件的.config (内核的配置文件)\nmake localmodconfig会执行lsmod命令查看当前系统中加载了哪些模块(Modules)，并最后将原来的.config中不需要的模块去掉，仅保留前面lsmod出来的这些模块，从而简化了内核的配置过程。\n这样做确实方便了很多，但是也有个缺点：该方法仅能使编译出的内核支持当前内核已经加载的模块。因为该方法使用的是lsmod的结果，如果有的模块当前没有加载，那么就不会编到新的内核中。\nThere’s an additional “make localyesconfig” target, in case you don’t want to use modules and/or initrds.\n几条好的建议：\n除非您使用初始化ramdisk (initrd)，否则绝不要把挂载根文件系统必需的驱动程序(硬件驱动以及文件系统驱动)编译成模块！而如果您确实使用初始化ramdisk，请为ext2FS支持选项选择Y，因为ramdisk使用该文件系统。您还需要initrd支持。\n如果您系统中有网卡，将它们的驱动编译成模块。这样，您就能够在/etc/modules.conf中用别名定义哪一块网卡第一，哪一块第二，等等。如果您将驱动程序编译进了内核，它们加载的顺序将取决于当初它们链接进内核的顺序，而这不一定是您想要的。\n最后，如果您不清楚某个选项的含义，请阅读其帮助！而如果该帮助信息依然不能解决您的困惑，请保留该选项原来的样子。(在config和oldconfig中可以按?键访问帮助。)\n配置最终结束后，请保存您的配置并退出。\n原文在这里\n"},"linux_kernel_compile/how_to_compile.html":{"url":"linux_kernel_compile/how_to_compile.html","title":"How

Linux，在/boot目录下有一些与Linux内核有关的文件 .\n　　编译过RedHat Linux内核的人对其中的System.map、vmlinuz、initrd-2.4.7-10.img印象可能比较深刻，因为编译内核过程中涉及到这些文件的建立等操作。那么这几个文件是怎么产生的?又有什么作用呢?\n对于Linux内核，编译可以生成不同格式的映像文件，例如：\nmake zImage\nmake uImage\nmake bzImage\nzImage\n是ARM Linux常用的一种压缩映像文件不能超过512KB，bzImage 即bigzImage ，二者的内核都是gzip压缩的\nuImage\n是U-boot专用的映像文件，它是在`zImage之前加上一个长度为0x40的“头”，说明这个映像文件的\n类型、加载位置、生成时间、大小等信息。换句话说，如果直接从uImage的0x40位置开始执行，zImage和\nuImage没有任何区别。另外，Linux2.4内核不支持uImage，Linux2.6内核加入了很多对嵌入式系统的支持\n，但是uImage的生成也需要设置。\nvmlinuz\n　　vmlinuz是可引导的、压缩的内核。“vm”代表“Virtual Memory”。Linux\n　　支持虚拟内存，不像老的操作系统比如DOS有640KB内存的限制。Linux能够使用硬盘空间作为虚拟内存，因此得名“vm”。\n　　vmlinuz是可执行 的Linux内核，它位于/boot/vmlinuz，它一般是一个软链接，比如图中是vmlinuz-2.4.7-10\n　　的软链接。\nvmlinuz的建立有两种方式:\n一 是编译内核时通过`make zImage`创建，手动拷贝到/boot目录下面. zImage适用于小内核的情况，它的存在是为了向后的兼容性.\n　　二 是内核编译时通过命令make bzImage创建，然后手动拷贝至/boot目录下。bzImage是压缩的\n　　内核映像，需要注意，bzImage不是用bzip2压缩的,bz表示big zImage。 bzImage中的b是“big”意思。 zImage(vmlinuz)和bzImage(vmlinuz)都是用gzip压缩的。它们不仅是一个压缩文件，而且在这两个文件的开头部分内嵌有gzip解压缩代码。所以你不能用gunzip或gzip –dc解包vmlinuz。\n内核文件中包含一个微型的gzip用于解压缩内核并引导它。两者的不同之处在于，老的zImage解压缩内核到低端内存(第一个 640K)，bzImage解压缩内核到高端内存(1M以上)。如果内核比较小，那么可以采用zImage或bzImage之一，两种方式引导的系统运行 时是相同的。大的内核采用bzImage，不能采用zImage。\nvmlinux是未压缩的内核，vmlinuz是vmlinux的压缩文件。\ninitrd-x.x.x.img\n　　initrd是“initial ramdisk”的简写。initrd一般被用来临时的引导硬件到实际内核vmlinuz能够接管并继续引导的状态。图中的initrd-2.4.7-10.img主要是用于加载ext3等文件系统及scsi设备的驱动。\n　　比如，使用的是scsi硬盘，而内核vmlinuz中并没有这个scsi硬件的驱动，scsi模块是存储在根文件系统的/lib/modules下的，那么在装入scsi模块之前，内核不能加载根文件系统。为了解决这个问题，可以引导一个能够读实际内核的initrd内核并用initrd修正 scsi引导问题。initrd-2.4.7-10.img是用gzip压缩的文件，initrd实现加载一些模块和安装文件系统等功能。\ninitrd映象文件是使用initrd创建的。initrd实用程序能够创建initrd映象文件。这个命令是RedHat专有的(这也是为什么，在Linux内核包里/Documentation/Changes里面没有提到要将initrd升级）。其它Linux发行版或许有相应的命令。这是个很方便的实用程序。具体情况请看帮助:man initrd下面的命令创建initrd映象文件。\ninitrd映象文件是使用initrd创建的。initrd实用程序能够创建initrd映象文件。这个命令是RedHat专有的。其它Linux发行版或许有相应的命令。这是个很方便的实用程序。具体情况请看帮助:man initrd下面的命令创建initrd映象文件。\nuImage\nvmlinux是内核文件，zImage是一般情况下默认的压缩内核映像文件，压缩vmlinux，加上一段解压启动代码得到。而uImage是u-boot使用bootm命令引导的Linux压缩内核映像文件格式,是使用工具mkimage对普通的压缩内核映像文件（zImage）加工而得。它是uboot专用的映像文件，它是在zImage之前加上一个长度为 64字节的“头”，说明这个内核的版本、加载位置、生成时间、大小等信息；其0x40之后与zImage没区别。\n由于bootloader一般要占用0X0地址，所以，uImage相比zImage的好处就是可以和bootloader共存。\n其实就是一个自动跟手动的区别,有了uImage头部的描述,u-boot就知道对应Image的信息,如果没有头部则需要自己手动去搞那些参数。\n如何生成uImage文件？首先 在uboot的/tools目录下寻找mkimage文件，把其copy到系统/usr/local/bin目录下，这样就完成制作工具。然后在内核目录下运行make uImage，如果成功，便可以在arch/arm/boot/目录下发现uImage文件，其大小比zImage多64个字节。\n此外，平时调试用uImage，不用去管调整了哪些东西；zImage则是一切OK后直接烧0X0。开机就运行。\n"},"tools/":{"url":"tools/","title":"Tools","keywords":"","body":"Tools\n"},"tools/backup.html":{"url":"tools/backup.html","title":"backup","keywords":"","body":"backup\nData\nbackup\nssh

Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.\nFor almost all software projects, the source code is like the crown jewels - a precious asset whose value must be protected. For most software teams, the source code is a repository of the invaluable knowledge and understanding about the problem domain that the developers have collected and refined through careful effort. Version control protects source code from both catastrophe and the casual degradation of human error and unintended consequences.\nGit is a mature, actively maintained open source project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating system kernel. \nDeveloping software without using version control is risky, like not having backups. Version control can also enable developers to move faster and it allows software teams to preserve efficiency and agility as the team scales to include more developers.\nVersion Control Systems (VCS) have seen great improvements over the past few decades and some are better than others. VCS are sometimes known as SCM (Source Code Management) tools or RCS (Revision Control System). One of the most popular VCS tools in use today is called Git. Git is a Distributed VCS, a category known as DVCS, more on that later. Like many of the most popular VCS systems available today, Git is free and open source. Regardless of what they are called, or which system is used, the primary benefits you should expect from version control are as follows.\nA complete long-term change history of every file. This means every change made by many individuals over the years. Changes include the creation and deletion of files as well as edits to their contents. Different VCS tools differ on how well they handle renaming and moving of files. This history should also include the author, date and written notes on the purpose of each change. Having the complete history enables going back to previous versions to help in root cause analysis for bugs and it is crucial when needing to fix problems in older versions of software. If the software is being actively worked on, almost everything can be considered an \"older version\" of the software.\nBranching and merging. Having team members work concurrently is a no-brainer, but even individuals working on their own can benefit from the ability to work on independent streams of changes. Creating a \"branch\" in VCS tools keeps multiple streams of work independent from each other while also providing the facility to merge that work back together, enabling developers to verify that the changes on each branch do not conflict. Many software teams adopt a practice of branching for each feature or perhaps branching for each release, or both. There are many different workflows that teams can choose from when they decide how to make use of branching and merging facilities in VCS.\nTraceability. Being able to trace each change made to the software and connect it to project management and bug tracking software such as JIRA, and being able to annotate each change with a message describing the purpose and intent of the change can help not only with root cause analysis and other forensics. Having the annotated history of the code at your fingertips when you are reading the code, trying to understand what it is doing and why it is so designed can enable developers to make correct and harmonious changes that are in accord with the intended long-term design of the system. This can be especially important for working effectively with legacy code and is crucial in enabling developers to estimate future work with any accuracy.\n"},"git/getting-started.html":{"url":"git/getting-started.html","title":"Getting started","keywords":"","body":"Installation\nPlease refer to the guide.\nConfigure\nPlease complete all the steps below by git bash in windows or CLI in Linux\nYour Identity\nThe first thing you should do when you install Git is to set your user name and email address. This is important because every Git commit uses this information, and it’s immutably baked into the commits you start creating:\n$ git config --global user.name \"John Doe\"\n$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com\n\nAgain, you need to do this only once if you pass the --global option, because then Git will always use that information for anything you do on that system. If you want to override this with a different name or email address for specific projects, you can run the command without the --global option when you’re in that project.\nYour Editor\nNow that your identity is set up, you can configure the default text editor that will be used when Git needs you to type in a message. If not configured, Git uses your system’s default editor.\nIf you want to use a different text editor, such as VIM, you can do the following:\n$ git config --global core.editor vim\nWhile on a Windows system, if you want to use a different text editor, such as Notepad++, you can do the following:\nOn a x86 system\n$ git config --global core.editor \"'C:/Program Files/Notepad++/notepad++.exe' -multiInst -nosession\"\nOn a x64 system\n$ git config --global core.editor \"'C:/Program Files (x86)/Notepad++/notepad++.exe' -multiInst -nosession\"\nChecking Your Settings\nIf you want to check your settings, you can use the git config --list command to list all the settings Git can find at that point:\n$ git config --list\nuser.name=John Doe\nuser.email=johndoe@example.com\ncolor.status=auto\ncolor.branch=auto\ncolor.interactive=auto\ncolor.diff=auto\n...\nYou may see keys more than once, because Git reads the same key from different files (/etc/gitconfig and ~/.gitconfig, for example). In this case, Git uses the last value for each unique key it sees.\nYou can also check what Git thinks a specific key’s value is by typing git config :\n$ git config user.name\nJohn Doe\nUsing SSH\ncd \nmkdir .ssh\ncd .ssh\nssh-keygen -C 'YOUR_EMAIL@EMAIL.COM'\nDon't set 'passphrase' if you don't want to type password everytime you use it. If you want to know more. Do you need a passphrase.\nCopy and paste your complete public key to our git server.\nIf you don't have a account on our git server, please contact me.\nA complete public key example:\nssh-rsa AAVDihgxliarMlFoDnqxsDlgv12/WK6U7G7fcaCKdf6QhAqhFlmGPKPBFMlzQkFXsk8Q9ryAt AAA@BBB.CC\nGetting Help\nIf you ever need help while using Git, there are three ways to get the manual page (manpage) help for any of the Git commands:\n$ git help \n$ git  --help\n$ man git-\nFor example, you can get the manpage help for the config command by running\n$ git help config\nThese commands are nice because you can access them anywhere, even offline. If the manpages and this book aren’t enough and you need in-person help, you can try the #git or #github channel on the Freenode IRC server (irc.freenode.net). These channels are regularly filled with hundreds of people who are all very knowledgeable about Git and are often willing to help.\n"},"git/getting-a-git-repository.html":{"url":"git/getting-a-git-repository.html","title":"Getting a Git Repository","keywords":"","body":"Initializing a Repository in an Existing Directory\nIf you’re starting to track an existing project in Git, you need to go to the project’s directory and type:\n$ git init\nThis creates a new subdirectory named .git that contains all of your necessary repository files – a Git repository skeleton. At this point, nothing in your project is tracked yet. (See Git Internals for more information about exactly what files are contained in the .git directory you just created.)\nIf you want to start version-controlling existing files (as opposed to an empty directory), you should probably begin tracking those files and do an initial commit. You can accomplish that with a few git add commands that specify the files you want to track, followed by a git commit:\n$ git add *.c\n$ git add LICENSE\n$ git commit -m 'initial project version'\nWe’ll go over what these commands do in just a minute. At this point, you have a Git repository with tracked files and an initial commit.\nCloning an Existing Repository\nIf you want to get a copy of an existing Git repository – for example, a project you’d like to contribute to – the command you need is git clone. If you’re familiar with other VCS systems such as Subversion, you’ll notice that the command is clone and not checkout. This is an important distinction – instead of getting just a working copy, Git receives a full copy of nearly all data that the server has. Every version of every file for the history of the project is pulled down by default when you run git clone. In fact, if your server disk gets corrupted, you can often use nearly any of the clones on any client to set the server back to the state it was in when it was cloned (you may lose some server-side hooks and such, but all the versioned data would be there).\nYou clone a repository with git clone [url]. For example, if you want to clone the Git linkable library called libgit2, you can do so like this:\n$ git clone git@ict.eri.ntu.edu.sg:test_group/test_project.git\nThat creates a directory named “test_project”, initializes a .git directory inside it, pulls down all the data for that repository, and checks out a working copy of the latest version. If you go into the new test_project directory, you’ll see the project files in there, ready to be worked on or used. If you want to clone the repository into a directory named something other than “test_project”, you can specify that as the next command-line option:\n$ git clone git@ict.eri.ntu.edu.sg:test_group/test_project.git my_project\nThat command does the same thing as the previous one, but the target directory is called my_project.\nGit has a number of different transfer protocols you can use. The previous example uses the git:// protocol, but you may also see https:// or user@server:path/to/repo.git, which uses the SSH transfer protocol. Getting Git on a Server will introduce all of the available options the server can set up to access your Git repository and the pros and cons of each.\n"},"git/basic-usage.html":{"url":"git/basic-usage.html","title":"Basic usage","keywords":"","body":"Show Current Status\n$ git status\nOn branch master\nYour branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.\nnothing to commit, working tree clean\nTracking New File\ngit add YOUR_FILE_OR_FOLDER\nIf you run your status command again, you can see that your new file is now tracked and staged to be committed:\n$ git status\nOn branch master\nYour branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.\nChanges to be committed:\n  (use \"git reset HEAD ...\" to unstage)\n\n    new file:   README.md\nStaging Modified Files\nLet’s change a file that was already tracked. If you change a previously tracked file called readme.md and then run your git status command again, you get something that looks like this:\n$ git status\nOn branch master\nYour branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.\nChanges not staged for commit:\n  (use \"git add ...\" to update what will be committed)\n  (use \"git checkout -- ...\" to discard changes in working directory)\n\n        modified:   readme.md\n\nno changes added to commit (use \"git add\" and/or \"git commit -a\")\n\nTo know more details you can use diff tools to see what have changed of these tracked files:\n$ git diff\ndiff --git a/readme.md b/readme.md\nindex 9fd6ba9..dc23ecd 100644\n--- a/readme.md\n+++ b/readme.md\n@@ -1,4 +1,6 @@\n # this is a\n ## second line\n-### thrid line\n 1. new line\n+**some modifications **\n+another line\n+\n(END)\n\nFrom the output of diff tool we can see I deleted one line and add three lines.\nTo discard the modification you just did to last commmit:\n# longqi @ LQMacPro in ~/test_project on git:master o [14:34:04]\n$ git status\nOn branch master\n  (use \"git checkout -- ...\" to discard changes in working directory)\n\n        modified:   readme.md\n\nno changes added to commit (use \"git add\" and/or \"git commit -a\")\n# longqi @ LQMacPro in ~/test_project on git:master x [15:40:29]\n$ git checkout readme.md\n\n# longqi @ LQMacPro in ~/test_project on git:master o [15:41:25]\n$ git status\nOn branch master\nYour branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.\nnothing to commit, working tree clean\nIgnore Files\nOften, you’ll have a class of files that you don’t want Git to automatically add or even show you as being untracked. These are generally automatically generated files such as log files or files produced by your build system. In such cases, you can create a file listing patterns to match them named .gitignore. Here is an example .gitignore file:\n# no .a files\n*.a\n\n# but do track lib.a, even though you're ignoring .a files above\n!lib.a\n\n# only ignore the TODO file in the current directory, not subdir/TODO\n/TODO\n\n# ignore all files in the build/ directory\nbuild/\n\n# ignore doc/notes.txt, but not doc/server/arch.txt\ndoc/*.txt\n\n# ignore all .pdf files in the doc/ directory\ndoc/**/*.pdf\nGitHub maintains a fairly comprehensive list of good .gitignore file examples for dozens of projects and languages at here if you want a starting point for your project.\nGit Diff in an External Tool\nWe will continue to use the git diff command in various ways throughout the rest of the book. There is another way to look at these diffs if you prefer a graphical or external diff viewing program instead. If you run git difftool instead of git diff, you can view any of these diffs in software like emerge, vimdiff and many more (including commercial products). Run git difftool --tool-help to see what is available on your system.\nMeld as shown in the figure is my favourite diff and merge tool. I highly recommend meld as your diff and merge tool.\n\nCommitting Your Changes\nNow that your staging area is set up the way you want it, you can commit your changes. Remember that anything that is still unstaged – any files you have created or modified that you haven’t run git add on since you edited them – won’t go into this commit. They will stay as modified files on your disk. In this case, let’s say that the last time you ran git status, you saw that everything was staged, so you’re ready to commit your changes. The simplest way to commit is to type git commit:\n$ git commit\nDoing so launches your editor of choice. (This is set by your shell’s $EDITOR environment variable – usually vim or emacs, although you can configure it with whatever you want using the git config --global core.editor command as you saw in Getting Started).\nThe editor displays the following text (this example is a Vim screen):\n$ git commit readme.md\n\nupdate default voltage setting value from 200 to 380\n# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting\n# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.\n# Explicit paths specified without -i or -o; assuming --only paths...\n# On branch master\n# Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.\n#\n# Changes to be committed:\n#       modified:   readme.md\n#\nYou can see that the default commit message contains the latest output of the git status command commented out and one empty line on top. You can remove these comments and type your commit message, or you can leave them there to help you remember what you’re committing. (For an even more explicit reminder of what you’ve modified, you can pass the -v option to git commit. Doing so also puts the diff of your change in the editor so you can see exactly what changes you’re committing.) When you exit the editor, Git creates your commit with that commit message (with the comments and diff stripped out).\nAlternatively, you can type your commit message inline with the commit command by specifying it after a -m flag, like this:\n$ git commit -m 'update default voltage setting value from 200 to 380' readme.md\n\n[master d08b52b] update default voltage setting value from 200 to 380\n 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)\nNow you’ve created your first commit! You can see that the commit has given you some output about itself: which branch you committed to (master), what SHA-1 checksum the commit has (463dc4f), how many files were changed, and statistics about lines added and removed in the commit.\nRemember that the commit records the snapshot you set up in your staging area. Anything you didn’t stage is still sitting there modified; you can do another commit to add it to your history. Every time you perform a commit, you’re recording a snapshot of your project that you can revert to or compare to later.\nSkipping the Staging Area\nAlthough it can be amazingly useful for crafting commits exactly how you want them, the staging area is sometimes a bit more complex than you need in your workflow. If you want to skip the staging area, Git provides a simple shortcut. Adding the -a option to the git commit command makes Git automatically stage every file that is already tracked before doing the commit, letting you skip the git add part:\n$ git status\nOn branch master\nYour branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.\nChanges not staged for commit:\n  (use \"git add ...\" to update what will be committed)\n  (use \"git checkout -- ...\" to discard changes in working directory)\n\n    modified:   readme.md\n\nno changes added to commit (use \"git add\" and/or \"git commit -a\")\n$ git commit -a -m 'added new benchmarks'\n[master 83e38c7] added new benchmarks\n 1 file changed, 5 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)\nNotice how you don’t have to run git add on the readme.md file in this case before you commit. That’s because the -a flag includes all changed files. This is convenient, but be careful; sometimes this flag will cause you to include unwanted changes.\nTagging\nLike most VCSs, Git has the ability to tag specific points in history as being important. Typically people use this functionality to mark release points (v1.0, and so on). In this section, you’ll learn how to list the available tags, how to create new tags, and what the different types of tags are.\nListing the available tags in Git is straightforward. Just type git tag:\n# longqi @ LQMacPro in ~/PycharmProjects/Hybrid-Microgrid on git:RES_integration x [22:16:59]\n$ git tag\nauto_turn_on\ndelete_ModbusTCP\nmodbusTCP_end\nv1.0\nv1.1\nv2.0\nv2.0.1\nv2.0.2\nv2.1\nv2.2\nv2.3\nv3.0\nv4.0\nGit uses two main types of tags: lightweight and annotated.\nA lightweight tag is very much like a branch that doesn’t change – it’s just a pointer to a specific commit.\nAnnotated tags, however, are stored as full objects in the Git database. They’re checksummed; contain the tagger name, email, and date; have a tagging message; and can be signed and verified with GNU Privacy Guard (GPG). It’s generally recommended that you create annotated tags so you can have all this information; but if you want a temporary tag or for some reason don’t want to keep the other information, lightweight tags are available too.\nAnnotated Tags\nCreating an annotated tag in Git is simple. The easiest way is to specify -a when you run the tag command:\n$ git tag -a v1.4 -m \"my version 1.4\"\n$ git tag\nv0.1\nv1.3\nv1.4\nThe -m specifies a tagging message, which is stored with the tag. If you don’t specify a message for an annotated tag, Git launches your editor so you can type it in.\nYou can see the tag data along with the commit that was tagged by using the git show command:\n$ git show v1.4\ntag v1.4\nTagger: Ben Straub \nDate:   Sat May 3 20:19:12 2014 -0700\n\nmy version 1.4\n\ncommit ca82a6dff817ec66f44342007202690a93763949\nAuthor: Scott Chacon \nDate:   Mon Mar 17 21:52:11 2008 -0700\n\n    changed the version number\nThat shows the tagger information, the date the commit was tagged, and the annotation message before showing the commit information.\nLightweight Tags\nAnother way to tag commits is with a lightweight tag. This is basically the commit checksum stored in a file – no other information is kept. To create a lightweight tag, don’t supply the -a, -s, or -m option:\n$ git tag v1.4-lw\n$ git tag\nv0.1\nv1.3\nv1.4\nv1.4-lw\nv1.5\nThis time, if you run git show on the tag, you don’t see the extra tag information. The command just shows the commit:\n\n$ git show v1.4-lw\ncommit ca82a6dff817ec66f44342007202690a93763949\nAuthor: Scott Chacon \nDate:   Mon Mar 17 21:52:11 2008 -0700\n\n    changed the version number\nViewing the Commit History\nAfter you have created several commits, or if you have cloned a repository with an existing commit history, you’ll probably want to look back to see what has happened. The most basic and powerful tool to do this is the git log command.\n# longqi @ LQMacPro in ~/test_project on git:master o [15:59:44]\n$ git log\n\ncommit d08b52b0fa2d837a47b4151c155a14342ba6e8d6\nAuthor: longqi \nDate:   Thu Dec 15 15:56:03 2016 +0800\n\n    update default voltage setting value from 200 to 380\n\ncommit 3d7a77517bb06e44d505999240f9b8b614abec8d\nAuthor: longqi \nDate:   Tue Dec 13 17:34:33 2016 +0800\n\n    new line from longqi\n"},"git/branching.html":{"url":"git/branching.html","title":"Branching","keywords":"","body":"To really understand the way Git does branching, we need to take a step back and examine how Git stores its data.\nAs you may remember from Getting Started, Git doesn’t store data as a series of changesets or differences, but instead as a series of snapshots.\nWhen you make a commit, Git stores a commit object that contains a pointer to the snapshot of the content you staged. This object also contains the author’s name and email, the message that you typed, and pointers to the commit or commits that directly came before this commit (its parent or parents): zero parents for the initial commit, one parent for a normal commit, and multiple parents for a commit that results from a merge of two or more branches.\nCreating a New Branch\nWhat happens if you create a new branch? Well, doing so creates a new pointer for you to move around. Let’s say you create a new branch called testing. You do this with the git branch command:\n# longqi @ LQMacPro in ~/test_project on git:master o [16:10:29]\n$ git branch develop\nThis creates a new pointer with name develop to the same commit you’re currently on.\n# longqi @ LQMacPro in ~/test_project on git:master o [16:10:58]\n$ git checkout -b develop\n\nSwitched to a new branch 'develop'\nThis creates a new pointer to the same commit you’re currently on and checkout to the new branch.\nTo see all branchs:\n# longqi @ LQMacPro in ~/test_project on git:develop o [16:12:18]\n$ git branch\n* develop\n  fix_bug_112\n  master\nSwitching Branches\nTo switch to an existing branch, you run the git checkout command.

Remote repositories are versions of your project that are hosted on the Internet or network somewhere. You can have several of them, each of which generally is either read-only or read/write for you. Collaborating with others involves managing these remote repositories and pushing and pulling data to and from them when you need to share work. Managing remote repositories includes knowing how to add remote repositories, remove remotes that are no longer valid, manage various remote branches and define them as being tracked or not, and more. In this section, we’ll cover some of these remote-management skills.\nShowing Your Remotes\nTo see which remote servers you have configured, you can run the git remote command. It lists the shortnames of each remote handle you’ve specified. If you’ve cloned your repository, you should at least see origin – that is the default name Git gives to the server you cloned from:\n$ git clone git@ict.eri.ntu.edu.sg:test_group/test_project.git\nCloning into 'test_project'...\nremote: Reusing existing pack: 1857, done.\nremote: Total 1857 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)\nReceiving objects: 100% (1857/1857), 374.35 KiB | 268.00 KiB/s, done.\nResolving deltas: 100% (772/772), done.\nChecking connectivity... done.\n$ cd test_project\n$ git remote -v\norigin    git@ict.eri.ntu.edu.sg:test_group/test_project.git (fetch)\norigin    git@ict.eri.ntu.edu.sg:test_group/test_project.git (push)\nIf you have more than one remote, the command lists them all. For example, a repository with multiple remotes for working with several collaborators might look something like this.\n$ cd grit\n$ git remote -v\nbakkdoor  https://github.com/bakkdoor/grit (fetch)\nbakkdoor  https://github.com/bakkdoor/grit (push)\ncho45     https://github.com/cho45/grit (fetch)\ncho45     https://github.com/cho45/grit (push)\ndefunkt   https://github.com/defunkt/grit (fetch)\ndefunkt   https://github.com/defunkt/grit (push)\nkoke      git://github.com/koke/grit.git (fetch)\nkoke      git://github.com/koke/grit.git (push)\norigin    git@github.com:mojombo/grit.git (fetch)\norigin    git@github.com:mojombo/grit.git (push)\nThis means we can pull contributions from any of these users pretty easily. We may additionally have permission to push to one or more of these.\nAdding Remote Repositories\nWe’ve mentioned and given some demonstrations of how the clone command implicitly adds the origin remote for you. Here’s how to add a new remote explicitly. To add a new remote Git repository as a shortname you can reference easily, run git remote add  :\n$ git remote\norigin\n$ git remote add pb https://github.com/paulboone/ticgit\n$ git remote -v\norigin    https://github.com/schacon/ticgit (fetch)\norigin    https://github.com/schacon/ticgit (push)\npb    https://github.com/paulboone/ticgit (fetch)\npb    https://github.com/paulboone/ticgit (push)\nNow you can use the string pb on the command line in lieu of the whole URL. For example, if you want to fetch all the information that Paul has but that you don’t yet have in your repository, you can run git fetch pb:\n$ git fetch pb\nremote: Counting objects: 43, done.\nremote: Compressing objects: 100% (36/36), done.\nremote: Total 43 (delta 10), reused 31 (delta 5)\nUnpacking objects: 100% (43/43), done.\nFrom https://github.com/paulboone/ticgit\n * [new branch]      master     -> pb/master\n * [new branch]      ticgit     -> pb/ticgit\nPaul’s master branch is now accessible locally as pb/master – you can merge it into one of your branches, or you can check out a local branch at that point if you want to inspect it. \nFetching and Pulling from Your Remotes\nAs you just saw, to get data from your remote projects, you can run:\n$ git fetch [remote-name]\nThe command goes out to that remote project and pulls down all the data from that remote project that you don’t have yet. After you do this, you should have references to all the branches from that remote, which you can merge in or inspect at any time.\nIf you clone a repository, the command automatically adds that remote repository under the name “origin”. So, git fetch origin fetches any new work that has been pushed to that server since you cloned (or last fetched from) it. It’s important to note that the git fetch command only downloads the data to your local repository – it doesn’t automatically merge it with any of your work or modify what you’re currently working on. You have to merge it manually into your work when you’re ready.\nIf your current branch is set up to track a remote branch, you can use the git pull command to automatically fetch and then merge that remote branch into your current branch. This may be an easier or more comfortable workflow for you; and by default, the git clone command automatically sets up your local master branch to track the remote master branch (or whatever the default branch is called) on the server you cloned from. Running git pull generally fetches data from the server you originally cloned from and automatically tries to merge it into the code you’re currently working on.\nPushing to Your Remotes\nWhen you have your project at a point that you want to share, you have to push it upstream. The command for this is simple: git push [remote-name] [branch-name]. If you want to push your master branch to your origin server (again, cloning generally sets up both of those names for you automatically), then you can run this to push any commits you’ve done back up to the server:\n$ git push origin master\nThis command works only if you cloned from a server to which you have write access and if nobody has pushed in the meantime. If you and someone else clone at the same time and they push upstream and then you push upstream, your push will rightly be rejected. You’ll have to fetch their work first and incorporate it into yours before you’ll be allowed to push. See Git Branching for more detailed information on how to push to remote servers.\n"},"git/merging.html":{"url":"git/merging.html","title":"Merging","keywords":"","body":"Basic Merging\nLet’s go through a simple example of branching and merging with a workflow that you might use in the real world. You’ll follow these steps:\n\nDo work on a web site.\nCreate a branch for a new story you’re working on.\nDo some work in that branch.\n\nAt this stage, you’ll receive a call that another issue is critical and you need a hotfix. You’ll do the following:\n\nSwitch to your production branch.\nCreate a branch to add the hotfix.\nAfter it’s tested, merge the hotfix branch, and push to production.\n\nSwitch back to your original story and continue working.\nYou’ve decided that you’re going to work on issue #53 in whatever issue-tracking system your company uses. \n# longqi @ LQMacPro in ~/test_project on git:develop o [16:24:07]\n$ git checkout -b iss53\nSwitched to a new branch 'iss53'\n\nYou work on your web site and do some commits. Doing so moves the iss53 branch forward, because you have it checked out (that is, your HEAD is pointing to it):\n$ vim index.html\n$ git commit -a -m 'added a new footer [issue 53]'\n\nNow you get the call that there is an issue with the web site, and you need to fix it immediately. With Git, you don’t have to deploy your fix along with the iss53 changes you’ve made, and you don’t have to put a lot of effort into reverting those changes before you can work on applying your fix to what is in production. All you have to do is switch back to your master branch.\nHowever, before you do that, note that if your working directory or staging area has uncommitted changes that conflict with the branch you’re checking out, Git won’t let you switch branches. It’s best to have a clean working state when you switch branches. For now, let’s assume you’ve committed all your changes, so you can switch back to your master branch:\n$ git checkout master\nSwitched to branch 'master'\nAt this point, your project working directory is exactly the way it was before you started working on issue #53, and you can concentrate on your hotfix. This is an important point to remember: when you switch branches, Git resets your working directory to look like it did the last time you committed on that branch. It adds, removes, and modifies files automatically to make sure your working copy is what the branch looked like on your last commit to it.\nNext, you have a hotfix to make. Let’s create a hotfix branch on which to work until it’s completed:\n$ git checkout -b hotfix\nSwitched to a new branch 'hotfix'\n$ vim index.html\n$ git commit -a -m 'fixed the broken email address'\n[hotfix 1fb7853] fixed the broken email address\n 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)\n\nYou can run your tests, make sure the hotfix is what you want, and merge it back into your master branch to deploy to production. You do this with the git merge command:\n$ git checkout master\n$ git merge hotfix\nUpdating f42c576..3a0874c\nFast-forward\n index.html | 2 ++\n 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)\nYou’ll notice the phrase “fast-forward” in that merge. Because the commit C4 pointed to by the branch hotfix you merged in was directly ahead of the commit C2 you’re on, Git simply moves the pointer forward. To phrase that another way, when you try to merge one commit with a commit that can be reached by following the first commit’s history, Git simplifies things by moving the pointer forward because there is no divergent work to merge together – this is called a “fast-forward.”\nYour change is now in the snapshot of the commit pointed to by the master branch, and you can deploy the fix.\n\nAfter your super-important fix is deployed, you’re ready to switch back to the work you were doing before you were interrupted. However, first you’ll delete the hotfix branch, because you no longer need it – the master branch points at the same place. You can delete it with the -d option to git branch:\n$ git branch -d hotfix\nDeleted branch hotfix (3a0874c).\nNow you can switch back to your work-in-progress branch on issue #53 and continue working on it.\n$ git checkout iss53\nSwitched to branch \"iss53\"\n$ vim index.html\n$ git commit -a -m 'finished the new footer [issue 53]'\n[iss53 ad82d7a] finished the new footer [issue 53]\n1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)\n\nIt’s worth noting here that the work you did in your hotfix branch is not contained in the files in your iss53 branch. If you need to pull it in, you can merge your master branch into your iss53 branch by running git merge master, or you can wait to integrate those changes until you decide to pull the iss53 branch back into master later.\nSuppose you’ve decided that your issue #53 work is complete and ready to be merged into your master branch. In order to do that, you’ll merge your iss53 branch into master, much like you merged your hotfix branch earlier. All you have to do is check out the branch you wish to merge into and then run the git merge command:\n$ git checkout master\nSwitched to branch 'master'\n$ git merge iss53\nMerge made by the 'recursive' strategy.\nindex.html |    1 +\n1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)\nThis looks a bit different than the hotfix merge you did earlier. In this case, your development history has diverged from some older point. Because the commit on the branch you’re on isn’t a direct ancestor of the branch you’re merging in, Git has to do some work. In this case, Git does a simple three-way merge, using the two snapshots pointed to by the branch tips and the common ancestor of the two.\n\nInstead of just moving the branch pointer forward, Git creates a new snapshot that results from this three-way merge and automatically creates a new commit that points to it. This is referred to as a merge commit, and is special in that it has more than one parent.\n\nIt’s worth pointing out that Git determines the best common ancestor to use for its merge base; this is different than older tools like CVS or Subversion (before version 1.5), where the developer doing the merge had to figure out the best merge base for themselves. This makes merging a heck of a lot easier in Git than in these other systems.\nNow that your work is merged in, you have no further need for the iss53 branch. You can close the ticket in your ticket-tracking system, and delete the branch:\n$ git branch -d iss53\nAbove is the example of basic merging.\nMerging below will involve conflict.\nBasic Merge Conflicts\nOccasionally, this process doesn’t go smoothly. If you changed the same part of the same file differently in the two branches you’re merging together, Git won’t be able to merge them cleanly. If your fix for issue #53 modified the same part of a file as the hotfix, you’ll get a merge conflict that looks something like this:\n$ git merge iss53\nAuto-merging index.html\nCONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in index.html\nAutomatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.\nGit hasn’t automatically created a new merge commit. It has paused the process while you resolve the conflict. If you want to see which files are unmerged at any point after a merge conflict, you can run git status:\n$ git status\nOn branch master\nYou have unmerged paths.\n  (fix conflicts and run \"git commit\")\n\nUnmerged paths:\n  (use \"git add ...\" to mark resolution)\n\n    both modified:      index.html\n\nno changes added to commit (use \"git add\" and/or \"git commit -a\")\nAnything that has merge conflicts and hasn’t been resolved is listed as unmerged. Git adds standard conflict-resolution markers to the files that have conflicts, so you can open them manually and resolve those conflicts. Your file contains a section that looks something like this:\ncontact : email.support@github.com\n=======\n\n please contact us at support@github.com\n\n>>>>>>> iss53:index.html\nThis means the version in HEAD (your master branch, because that was what you had checked out when you ran your merge command) is the top part of that block (everything above the =======), while the version in your iss53 branch looks like everything in the bottom part. In order to resolve the conflict, you have to either choose one side or the other or merge the contents yourself. For instance, you might resolve this conflict by replacing the entire block with this:\n\nplease contact us at email.support@github.com\n\nThis resolution has a little of each section, and the , =======, and >>>>>>> lines have been completely removed. After you’ve resolved each of these sections in each conflicted file, run git add on each file to mark it as resolved. Staging the file marks it as resolved in Git.\nIf you want to use a graphical tool to resolve these issues, you can run git mergetool, which fires up an appropriate visual merge tool and walks you through the conflicts:\n$ git mergetool\nThis message is displayed because 'merge.tool' is not configured.\nSee 'git mergetool --tool-help' or 'git help config' for more details.\n'git mergetool' will now attempt to use one of the following tools:\nopendiff kdiff3 tkdiff xxdiff meld tortoisemerge gvimdiff diffuse diffmerge ecmerge p4merge araxis bc3 codecompare vimdiff emerge\nMerging:\nindex.html\n\nNormal merge conflict for 'index.html':\n  {local}: modified file\n  {remote}: modified file\nHit return to start merge resolution tool (opendiff):\nYou can set the merge tool on windows:\ngit config --global merge.tool meld\ngit config --global mergetool.meld.path /c/Program files (x86)/meld/bin/meld\nor on Linux:\ngit config --global merge.tool meld\ngit config --global mergetool.meld.path /usr/bin/meld\n"},"git/git_merge_tool.html":{"url":"git/git_merge_tool.html","title":"git merge tool","keywords":"","body":"git merge tool\nsetting merge tool for `git mergetoolFor the default path of meld (you can use Unix path style in git bash): \ngit config --global mergetool.meld.path /C/Program\\ files\\ \\(x86\\)/Meld/meld/meld.exe\nfor the non-default path you can use tab key, it will suggest the pathso its easy to get it right.`\nnote sometimes you need use meldc.exe or bin/meld,\nyou may also want to check this:how-to-set-meld-as-git-mergetool\nerror: too many arguments\n$ git config --global diff.external meld\n$ git diff filename\nUsage:\n  meld                        Start with an empty window\n  meld              Start a version control comparison\n  meld   [] Start a 2- or 3-way file comparison\n  meld   []    Start a 2- or 3-way directory comparison\n  meld             Start a comparison between file and dir/file\n\nmeld: error: too many arguments (wanted 0-3, got 7)\nexternal diff died, stopping at src/transferlistfilterswidget.h.\n\nMeld will open but it will complain about bad parameters.

In this space, the inclusion of even a floating point unit would be considered an unnecessary luxury.  To perform floating point operations with these processors, software emulation is required.\nHigher-end Arm processors come bundled with additional capability that enables hardware execution of floating point operations.  The difference between these two architectures gave rise to two separate Embedded Application Binary Interfaces or EABIs for ARM: soft float and VFP (Vector Floating Point).  Although there is forward compatibility between soft and hard float, there is no backward compatibility.  And in fact, when it comes to providing binaries for [Java SE Embedded for Arm]:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/embedded/downloads/javase/index.html , Oracle provides two separate options: a soft float binary and a VFP binary.  In the Linux community, releases built upon both these EABIs are refereed to as armel based distributions.\nEnter armhf.  Although a big step up in performance, the VFP EABI utilizes less-than-optimal argument passing when a floating point operations take place.  In this scenario, floating point arguments must first be passed through integer registers prior to executing in the floating point unit.  A new EABI, referred to as armhf optimizes the calling convention for floating point operations by passing arguments directly into floating point registers.  It furthermore includes a more efficient system call convention.  The end result is applications compiled with the armhf standard should demonstrate modest performance improvement in some cases, and significant improvement for floating point intensive applications.\nAlas, armhf represents yet another binary incompatible standard, but one that has already gained considerable traction in the community. Although still relatively early, the transition from armel to armhf is underway.  In fact, Ubuntu has already announced that future releases will only be built to the armhf standard, effectively obsoleting armel. As mentioned in Henrik's Stahl's Blog, an armhf version of Java SE Embedded is in the works, and we have already made available a armhf-based developer Preview of JDK 8 with JavaFX: http://jdk8.java.net/fxarmpreview/javafx-arm-developer-preview.html.\nIn the interim, we will have to deal with the incompatibilities between armel and armhf.  Most recently we've seen a rash of failed attempts to run the ArmV7 VFP Java SE Embedded binary on top of an armhf-based Linux distro.  During diagnosis, the question becomes, how can I determine whether my Linux distribution is based on armel or armhf?  Turns out this is not as straightforward as one might think.  Aside from experience and anecdotal evidence, one possible way to ascertain whether you're running on armel or armhf is to run the following obscure command:\nreadelf -A /proc/self/exe | grep Tag_ABI_VFP_args\nIf the Tag_ABI_VFP_args tag is found, then you're running on an armhf system.  If nothing is returned, then it's armel.  To show you an example, here's what happens on a Raspberry Pi running the Raspbian distribution:\nreadelf -A /proc/self/exe | grep Tag_ABI_VFP_args\nTag_ABI_VFP_args: VFP registers\nThis indicates an armhf distro, which in fact is what Raspbian is.  On the original, soft-float Debian Wheezy distribution, here's what happens:\nreadelf -A /proc/self/exe | grep Tag_ABI_VFP_args\nNothing returned indicates that this is indeed armel.\nMany thanks to the folks participating in this Raspberry Pi forum topic for providing this suggestion.\ncome from: https://blogs.oracle.com/jtc/entry/is_it_armhf_or_armel\n"},"file/":{"url":"file/","title":"File","keywords":"","body":"All the file related operations\n"},"file/mount_img.html":{"url":"file/mount_img.html","title":"Moung IMG File","keywords":"","body":"Mount img file in Linux\n\nCheck 'disk' structure by fdisk:\n \n\nCalculate the offset: offset = SECTOR_SIZE * START_UNIT\n The offset in the example: offset = 512 * 8192\n \n\n\n"}}}
