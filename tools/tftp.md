# TFTP
##introduction and installation
TFTP is a popular method of booting IP phones, routers, and net boot capable PCs. It provides a simple way to download files to clients. TFTP requires a server to be running somewhere on the network, though.

I will use `tftp-hpa` here.
if you have not installed it,

run `sudo apt-get install tftp-hpa` if you are using debian beased linux distribution
